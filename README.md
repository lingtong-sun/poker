Wrote up a python program to parse some of my online poker hand history. 
The hand formats are standard and can be viewed in the hand_history folder. 
Essentially, relies on regex and a big loop to yank out the important information. 
Made a few graphs for reference. 

Most of the code is in handparser.py and models.py.

#TODOS:
1. Analyze without blinds.
2. Come up with some features and analyze those.
3. Some sort of UI so the graphs can be generated by user. 
4. Write a bot??
